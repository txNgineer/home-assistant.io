This add-on allows you to set up a [Samba](https://samba.org/) server to access Hass.io folders using Windows network shares.

<p class='note warning'>
Be careful when setting up port forwarding for remote access. If you don't restrict access by setting a username and strong password, your configuration could be exposed to the entire Internet!
