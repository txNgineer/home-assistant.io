[Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text directly in your browser. Over 40 programming languages are supported including Python, R and Julia. Visit [https://try.jupyter.org/](https://try.jupyter.org/) to try out Jupyter notebooks without installing anything.
