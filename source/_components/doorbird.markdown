The `doorbird` implementation allows you to integrate your [DoorBird](http://www.doorbird.com/) device in Home Assistant.

## {% linkable_title Setup %}

The user, which you are going to use with Home Assistant, needs the "API-Operator" permission enabled.

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To connect your device, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
doorbird:
  token: YOUR_DOORBIRD_TOKEN
  devices:
    - host: DOORBIRD_IP_OR_HOSTNAME
      username: YOUR_USERNAME
      password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
token:
  description: Token to be used to authenticate Doorbird calls to Home Assistant. This can be obtained from your "Digital Passport" document provided with your Doorbird.
  required: true
  type: string
devices:
  description: List of Doorbird devices.
  required: true
  type: list
  keys:
    host:
      description: The LAN IP address or hostname of your device. You can find this by going to the [DoorBird Online check](http://www.doorbird.com/checkonline) and entering the information from the paper that was included in the box.
      required: true
      type: string
    username:
      description: The username of a non-administrator user account on the device. This user needs the "API-Operator" permission enabled on Doorbird. It is recommended to set up a new account on your Doorbird for use with Home Assistant. This can be added via the Doorbird App by choosing Administration -> (User) Add. When the new account is created, you will need to enable the permission "API-Operator" in the "permissions" option.
      required: true
      type: string
    password:
      description: The password for the user specified.
      required: true
      type: string
    name:
      description: Custom name for this device.
      required: false
      type: string
    hass_url_override:
      description: If your DoorBird cannot connect to the machine running Home Assistant because you are using dynamic DNS or some other HTTP configuration (such as HTTPS), specify the LAN IP of the machine here to force a LAN connection.
      required: false
      type: string
    monitored_conditions:
      description: Monitor motion and/or doorbell events for this device.
      required: false
      type: string
      keys:
        doorbell:
          description: Monitor doorbell events.
        motion:
          description: Monitor motion events (Motion monitoring must be enabled on the doorstation via DoorBird app).
        relay:
          description: Monitor relay events. This event is fired even if a relay is not physically connected to the door station.  Can be used to lock/unlock any smart lock present in Home Assistant via the Doorbird app.

{% endconfiguration %}

The configuration above is also used by the following platforms:

- [Camera](/components/camera.doorbird): View live and historical event based images.
- [Switch](/components/switch.doorbird): Enable control of relays and camera night vision.


## {% linkable_title Full example %}


```yaml
doorbird:
  token: YOUR_DOORBIRD_TOKEN
  devices:
    - host: DOORBIRD_IP_OR_HOSTNAME
      username: YOUR_USERNAME
      password: YOUR_PASSWORD
      hass_url_override: HASS_URL
      name: Front Door
    - host: DOORBIRD_IP_OR_HOSTNAME
      username: YOUR_USERNAME
      password: YOUR_PASSWORD
      name: Driveway Gate
      monitored_conditions:
        - doorbell
        - motion
        - relay
```

## {% linkable_title Events %}

Home Assistant will fire an event any time a `monitored_condition` happens on a doorstation.  Event names are created using the format `doorbird_{station}_{event}` (Examples: `doorbird_side_entry_button`, `doorbird_side_entry_motion`).  You can verify the assigned event names in the Available Events list on the Events developer view.

<p class="note info">
Home Assistant will register the monitored conditions with the device as schedule entries that correspond to favorites on startup. If you remove monitored conditions from your configuration, Home Assistant will attempt to remove these items from the device. However, in some cases, such as if the IP address of the machine running Home Assistant changes or if the device is renamed in your configuration, this will not work correctly and some data will be left in device storage.
<br><br>
This should not cause any problems, but if you would like to remove it, open a new browser window and navigate to `{Home Assistant URL}/api/doorbird/clear/{DoorBird name}`. Replace `{Home Assistant URL}` with the full path to your running instance, such as `http://localhost:8123`. Replace `{DoorBird name}` with the name specified in your configuration for the device you would like to clear, or how it appears in the Home Assistant UI if you have not specified one, such as `DoorBird 1`. Then use the mobile app to reschedule push notifications.
<br><br>
Please note that clearing device registrations will prevent the device from sending pushes to Home Assistant until you restart your instance with the component enabled. It could also affect other third-party applications you may use with your DoorBird device. It will not break the official mobile app in any way, so mobile push notifications will still work.
</p>

#### {% linkable_title Event Data %}

Each event includes live image and video URLs for the Doorbird device that triggered the event. These URLs can be found on the event data and can be useful in automation actions.  For example, you could use `html5_viewer_url` on a notification to be linked directly to the live view of the device that triggered the automation.

<p class="note">
The URLs on the event will be based on the configuration used to connect to your Doorbird device.  Ability to connect from outside your network will depend on your configuration.
</p>

### {% linkable_title Automation Example %}

```yaml
- alias: Doorbird Ring
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: doorbird_side_entry_button
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
      entity_id: light.side_entry_porch
```
