The `nest` climate platform lets you control a thermostat from [Nest](https://nest.com).

<p class='note'>
You must have the [Nest component](/components/nest/) configured to use these sensors. The `nest` climate component will automatically be setup when you do. Please note due to limitations with the European Nest Thermostat E, integration with Home Assistant for that thermostat is not possible.
