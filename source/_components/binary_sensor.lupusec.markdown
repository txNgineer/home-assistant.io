The `lupusec` security control panel platform allows you to control your [Lupusec](https://www.lupus-electronics.de) devices.

This platform will add `door contacts` and `window contacts` to your Home Assistant setup.

For the sensors to work you have to setup your [`lupusec` component](/components/lupusec/).
