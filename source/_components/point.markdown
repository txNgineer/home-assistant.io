The Point component is the main component to integrate the [Minut Point](https://minut.com/). To connect Point, you will have to [sign up for a developer account](https://minut.com/community/developers/) and get a `client_id` and `client_secret` using the `callback url`  as `base_url` + `/api/minut` eg. `http://localhost:8123/api/minut`. The `client_id` and `client_secret` should be used as below. 

Once Home Assistant is started, a configurator will pop up asking you to Authenticate your Point account via a link when you follow the link and have clicked on **Accept** you will be redirected to the `callback url` and the Point integration will be automatically configured and you can go back to the original dialog and press **Submit**.

### {% linkable_title Configuration %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
point:
  client_id: CLIENT_ID
  client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET
```

{% configuration %}
client_id:
  description: Your Minut Point developer client ID.
  required: true
  type: string
client_secret:
  description: Your Minut Point developer client secret.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

<p class='note'>
The Point is just active occasionally so the sensors are only updated every hour or so.
The events sent from the Point is sent as a webhook back to Home Assistant with `event_type` as `point_webhook_received`, please consider the documentation for the [IFTT](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/ifttt/) component on how to write automations for webhooks.
