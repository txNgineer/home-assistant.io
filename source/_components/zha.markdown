[Zigbee Home Automation](http://www.zigbee.org/zigbee-for-developers/applicationstandards/zigbeehomeautomation/)
integration for Home Assistant allows you to connect many off-the-shelf Zigbee based devices to Home Assistant, using one of the available Zigbee radio modules compatible with [zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy) (an open source Python library implementing a Zigbee stack, which in turn relies on separate libraries which can each interface a with Zigbee radio module a different manufacturer).

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary Sensor](../binary_sensor.zha) (e.g., motion and door sensors)
- [Sensor](../sensor.zha) (e.g., temperature sensors)
- [Light](../light.zha)
- [Switch](../switch.zha)
- [Fan](../fan.zha)

Known working Zigbee radio modules:

- EmberZNet based radios using the EZSP protocol (via the [bellows](https://github.com/zigpy/bellows) library for zigpy)
  - [Nortek GoControl QuickStick Combo Model HUSBZB-1 (Z-Wave & Zigbee USB Adapter)](https://www.nortekcontrol.com/products/2gig/husbzb-1-gocontrol-quickstick-combo/)
  - [Elelabs Zigbee USB Adapter](https://elelabs.com/products/elelabs_usb_adapter.html)
  - [Elelabs Zigbee Raspberry Pi Shield](https://elelabs.com/products/elelabs_zigbee_shield.html)
- XBee Zigbee based radios (via the [zigpy-xbee](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-xbee) library for zigpy)
  - Digi XBee Series 2C (S2C) modules
- Dresden-Elektronik deCONZ based Zigbee radios (via the [zigpy-deconz](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-deconz) library for zigpy)
  - [ConBee USB adapter from Dresden-Elektronik](https://www.dresden-elektronik.de/conbee/)
  - [RaspBee Raspberry Pi Shield from Dresden-Elektronik](https://www.dresden-elektronik.de/raspbee/)

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To configure the component, a `zha` section must be present in the `configuration.yaml`,
and the path to the serial device for the radio and path to the database which will persist your network data is required.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
zha:
  usb_path: /dev/ttyUSB2
  database_path: /home/homeassistant/.homeassistant/zigbee.db
```

{% configuration %}
radio_type:
  description: One of `ezsp` or `xbee`.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: ezsp
usb_path:
  description: Path to the serial device for the radio.
  required: true
  type: string
baudrate:
  description: Baud rate of the serial device.
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 57600
database_path:
  description: _Full_ path to the database which will keep persistent network data.
  required: true
  type: string
enable_quirks:
  description: Enable quirks mode for devices where manufacturers didn't follow specs.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: true
{% endconfiguration %}

To add new devices to the network, call the `permit` service on the `zha` domain. Do this by clicking the Service icon in Developer tools and typing `zha.permit` in the **Service** dropdown box. Next, follow the device instructions for adding, scanning or factory reset.
