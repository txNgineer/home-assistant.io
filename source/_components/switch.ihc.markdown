Before you can use the IHC Switch platform, you must setup the
[IHC Component](/components/ihc/)

When auto setup is enabled the following products will be found in the ihc
project and setup as switch devices:

- Wireless plug outlet
- Wireless relay
- Mobile wireless relay
- Dataline plug outlet

To manually configure IHC switches insert the "switch" section in your
IHC configuration:

```yaml
ihc:
  - url: 'http://192.168.1.3'
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
    info: true 
    switch:
      - id: 12345
      - id: 12346
```

{% configuration %}
switch:

  required: false
  type: map
  keys:
    id:
      description: The IHC resource id.
      required: true
      type: integer
    name:
      description: The name of the component
      required: false
      type: string
    note:
      description: Descriptive note.
      required: false
      type: string
    position:
      description: Where it is placed.
      required: false
      type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

The resource id should be a boolean resource (On/Off).
For more information about IHC resource ids see
[Manual Setup](/components/ihc/#manual-setup).
