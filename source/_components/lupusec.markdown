The `lupusec` component allows the user to integrate their Lupusec alarm control panel and ultimately all connected sensors and other devices. For more information about the LUPUS-Electronics security system please visit their [website](https://www.lupus-electronics.de).

Supported units:

- Lupusec XT1

The following devices are supported by the underlying `lupupy` Python library and integrated into Home Assistant.

- [Alarm Control Panel](/components/alarm_control_panel.lupusec/): Displays the alarm status and controls arming, disarming and home modus.
- [Binary Sensor](/components/binary_sensor.lupusec/): Displays the status of binary sensors. Currently only Door and window sensors are supported.
- [Switch](/components/switch.lupusec/): Turn off and on your Lupus power switches.
