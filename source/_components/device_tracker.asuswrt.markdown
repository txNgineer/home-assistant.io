The `asuswrt` platform offers presence detection by looking at connected devices to a [ASUSWRT](http://event.asus.com/2013/nw/ASUSWRT/) based router.

The platform will be automatically configured if Asuswrt component is configured.

For more configuration information see the [Asuswrt component](/components/asuswrt/) documentation.

See the [device tracker component page](/components/device_tracker/) for instructions how to configure the people to be tracked.
