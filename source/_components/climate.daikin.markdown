The `daikin` climate platform integrates Daikin air conditioning systems into Home Assistant, enabling control of setting the following parameters:

- **mode** (cool, heat, dry, fan only or auto)
- **fan speed** (on supported models)
- **target temperature**
- **swing mode** (on supported models)

Current temperature is displayed.

For configuration instructions, see [the Daikin component](/components/daikin/).
